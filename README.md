# Scientific Computing with Python: My personal implementations

## About This Repository

This repository contains my personal solutions and implementations for the projects and lessons in the freeCodeCamp course: ["Scientific Computing with Python"](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/).

### My Learning Approach: Building from scratch

My primary goal with this course was not just to complete the assignments, but to truly challenge myself and maximize my learning. To achieve this, every piece of code and every algorithm you find in this repository was designed and implemented from scratch by me unless indicated otherwise in my script comments.

Instead of relying on standard textbook solutions or the most common algorithms, I chose to build my own. This approach forced me to think critically about the problems and develop a deeper, more fundamental understanding of the underlying concepts.

**What this meant for my code:**

*   **Unique Solutions:** The algorithms here are my own creation and represent my personal problem solving journey.
*   **Variable Performance:** As a result of my "from scratch" method, you may find that some of my solutions are faster, while others might be slower or less optimized than conventional algorithms. This was a trade off I made purposely for the sake of learning.

Thank you for reading, and feel free to explore my work.
