# Scientific Computing with Python - freeCodeCamp
*projects rewritten in unique approaches*

## üéØ Repository Philosophy

> *"I understand that recursion would be much simpler, and cleaner. However, I chose to create my own solution instead to force myself to think. Because the best way to learn is through forcing uniqueness."*

This repository contains reimagined implementations of freeCodeCamp's Scientific Computing with Python certification projects. Rather than following conventional approaches, each project explores alternative algorithms, data structures, and programming paradigms to deepen understanding and showcase creative problem-solving.

## üìö Directories Overview

### `certificate-projects/`
- Includes the 5 necessary projects that must pass fCC test-cases and requirements to obtain the Scientific Computing with Python certificate.

### `fcc-reimagined-projects/`
- Includes projects in the Scientific Computing curriculum re-implemented from scratch by me, creating unique algorithms and design choices, chosen not for convenience but to maximize learning to truly challenge myself.

### `practice-projects/`
- Includes a few practice projects in the Scientific Computing curriculum, and while they are different (e.g. test-cases, CLI) the core ideas are the exact same, so I can't consider them my own.

## üöÄ Technical Highlights

### Design Principles
- **Educational Focus**: Each project prioritizes learning over convenience
- **Alternative Algorithms**: Deliberately avoids "obvious" or conventional solutions
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Extensive comments explaining design decisions
- **Error Handling**: Production-quality input validation and edge case management

### Code Quality Features
- **Memory Safety**: Shallow copying to prevent data mutation
- **State Management**: Explicit tracking of program state and progress
- **User Experience**: Interactive interfaces with clear feedback
- **Maintainability**: Well-structured code with separation of concerns

## üìñ Learning Outcomes

### Algorithm Design
- **State Management**: Manual handling of recursive-like processes
- **Pattern Recognition**: Mathematical insights in classic problems
- **Backtracking**: Custom implementation without recursion
- **Data Structure Optimization**: Efficient storage and retrieval patterns

### Software Engineering
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive validation and user feedback
- **File I/O**: Persistent storage with data integrity
- **User Interface**: Console-based interaction design
- **Code Documentation**: Self-documenting code with educational comments

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

Each project is self-contained and can be run independently:

```bash
# Run any project directly
python ArithmeticFormatter.py
python ExpensesTracker.py
python SudokuSolver.py
python TowerOfHanoi.py
```

## üìã Requirements

- Python ‚â•3.12
- No external dependencies required
- All projects use only Python standard library

## üéì Educational Value

This repository demonstrates that **learning often comes from constraints**. By refusing conventional solutions and forcing unique approaches, each project becomes a comprehensive study in:

- Algorithm design and optimization
- State management and data structures  
- Error handling and user experience
- Mathematical pattern recognition
- Alternative problem-solving methodologies

Perfect for developers who want to see familiar problems solved in unexpected ways! üåü
